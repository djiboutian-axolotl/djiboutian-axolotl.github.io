After sleeping 12+ hours, I can now conclude that I was, in fact, tired.

This tiredness, to me, is not a surprise. I have no historical example of myself being able to maintain such a sleepless schedule. The main surprise, though, is that I now feel more tired than I felt in previous days. This has been wont to occur, but it still makes little sense.

<!-- A cumbersome but valid way to make a centered, captioned image. -->
<figure class="align-center">
	<p align="center">
		<img src="/images/2021-05-17-cropped-sammie.png" alt="double-decker sammie">
	</p>
	<figcaption align="center"><i>A too-big sandwich that was meant to save time but took 30+ minutes to eat.</i></figcaption>
</figure> 

Now, I will have something to eat. What I will *not* eat, though, is a double-decker peanut butter and banana sandwich (pictured above). I thought making such a sandwich would save time. Instead, it took me 25 minutes to eat 3/4 of the thing, and then I was too full to run. Time, in short, was decidedly not saved.

### A code-related note

The image above was centered and captioned using the following code:
{% highlight html %}
<figure class="align-center">
 <p align="center">
  <img src="/images/image_name.png" alt="">
 </p>
 <figcaption align="center">
  <i>My caption.</i>
 </figcaption>
</figure> 
{% endhighlight %}
