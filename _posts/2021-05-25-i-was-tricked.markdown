I've felt sleepy for the past few days &ndash; or so I thought.

I've actually just had really bad allergies (specifically head congestion). Now that I know that, and now that I am taking the corresponding allergy medicine(s), hopefully I'll be able to think better and feel less tired.

End of message.
