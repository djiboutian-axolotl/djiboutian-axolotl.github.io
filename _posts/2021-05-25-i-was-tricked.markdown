I've felt sleepy for the past few days &ndash; or so I thought.

I've actually just had really bad allergies (specifically head congestion). Now that I know that, and now that I am taking the corresponding allergy medicine(s), hopefully I'll be able to think better and feel less tired.

End of message.

## Addendum
*(added 5/26; written from the point of view of 5/25 &ndash; i.e. "today" = 5/25)*

When I ran today, I saw three vultures eating a dead raccoon. I had first seen the raccoon two days ago. This is the fifth dead raccoon I've seen this spring &ndash; yuck!

It smelled horrible, but I'd say it was only the third-stinkiest dead raccoon I've smelled in the past 3 months.

The vultures flapped away heavily when I passed. That was also disgusting. At least they moved the raccoon out of the street and onto the grass. Now it's further from me when I run by.
