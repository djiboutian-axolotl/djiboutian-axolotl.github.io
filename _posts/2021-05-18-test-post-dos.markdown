Let's see what IFTTT decides to tweet when I make this second test post.

## Test title 2 to see what Twitter does

It'll be interesting to see what those different fields do. I'm not sure how much of the content will be tweeted, so that's why this is a longer post. I don't want to fall short of 255 characters (or whatever the precise limit is) because I want to see what happens if the post is over the tweet length limit.

I am excited to see how Twitter works with IFTTT. I think I used IFTTT before, but I don't remember, and it's been a little while.

OK, let's gooooo (pt. 2)!
