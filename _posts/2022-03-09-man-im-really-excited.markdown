Man, I'm actually really excited!

Just wanted to put that out there. I'd often thought of myself as a person who's detached from emotions. (Not in a psychopathic way &ndash; I care a lot about a lot of people.) It's more like I used to think that emotions were over there, and I was over here, and we coexisted but didn't really cross paths. I'd prided myself on my calmness and logic.

I've learned more and more that I wouldn't be affected the way I am, and that I wouldn't be joyous in the way I am, if this were the case. I'm not emotional, per se, but I've grown to embrace the human side of me.

In conclusion, I'm pretty excited! It's great when things seem like they'll work out how you've hoped!
