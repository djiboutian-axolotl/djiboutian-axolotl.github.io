Grading is fun; it is more fun when you know the answers, and better still when you understand them.

A much-needed note: grading is fun *when you're the one doing it.* When on the receiving end, grading is far less of a "blanket-fun" activity. Then, the quantity of fun derived is much more outcome-dependent. Of course, providing grading is more fun when those earning grades experience good outcomes, but the fun in providing grades is impacted far less by the outcomes as compared to the fun in receiving grades.
