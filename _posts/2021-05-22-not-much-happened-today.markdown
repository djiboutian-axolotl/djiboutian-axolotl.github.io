The fact that not much happened today was by design.

My sister, continuing her go-everywhere-and-do-everything spree, felt like going out again today. My mom did too, but I did not. I was, of course, invited to go, but I opted to stay home.

Instead of venturing far and wide, I ran, I read, and I ate. What, you might ask, did I eat? Dog food.

> What, you might ask, did I eat? Dog food.

The statement that I ate dog food is true, but it omits some very necessary information. My dog, in short, eats well. She pesters my dad for food, and he very willingly gives in. (My dog, though, is a very picky eater, so she is not fat.)

Over the years, she has trained my dad to feed her chicken. Through still more training, she has taught him that, specifically, she likes unseasoned chicken. Luckily for us, unseasoned chicken can be useful to have around. Therefore, when I say I ate dog food for dinner, I mean that my dad and I made fajita-ish things with some of my dog's chicken as the meat. 

Even though it was dog food, it was very good.

## A very brief summary of running

What follows is a brief summary of running &ndash; on the scale of "running today" (which does not mean "running in the modern era" but "running on May 22, 2021") rather than on the scale of briefly summarizing the history of running.

* I did not see a rainbow either in the sky or as a halo around my shadow.
* Today was very hot
* I still wore a shirt
** As a result, I ran slower than usual
*** But faster and more consistently than I thought I might
* My overall assessment: the run went well.

'Til next time!
