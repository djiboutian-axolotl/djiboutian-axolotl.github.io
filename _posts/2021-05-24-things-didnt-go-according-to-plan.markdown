I had a plan for today, but things did not go according to it.

My main plans were to start some research and to do some running. I did neither. This is because my cousin came to visit today.

Even the visit, though, did not proceed as planned. We wanted to go fruit-picking, but my cousin arrived too late for that to happen (not because his arrival time meant that fruit-picking would've conflicted with some pre-scheduled event; the only pre-scheduled event with which it conflicted was the place we planned to go).

The visit was still fun. He got to pet my dog (and my dog got to worry about being petted by him), we got to talk, and we got to play outside.

##### A note on running 

I didn't run today because ~~it was too cool today, and I am only used to running in hot weather now~~ my cousin came to visit, and also I decided I could benefit from a day off. I had run five days in a row, which is less than the ideal of six days in a row but still a lot for the current amount of running I can handle.

I'm still deciding if I will run tomorrow, or if I'll take a two-day break. Two-day breaks can be nice, but they also mean less running.

## Later

We took my dog for a walk again today. She walked well, and she seemed happy for the cool weather.

In other news, I am beginning to read more books again. (I may provide updates on them here &ndash; or I may not; ya never know what you'll find here!)
