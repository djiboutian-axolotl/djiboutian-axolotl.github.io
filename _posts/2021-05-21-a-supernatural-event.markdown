I know I said I wouldn't write about running today, but I have to!

When I was running today, I experienced a supernatural event. Now, I am sure the event itself has a natural explanation, and I think I've even found that explanation (and you might, too, as you read).

The probability that I bore witness to the event, though, is supernatural.

The event occurred for about 5 minutes &ndash; all during the first mile of the run, too, so far too early for any sort of exhaustion-induced hallucination.

## Some asides (of course)

Speaking of "hallucination", I need to throw in a plug for [The Halluci Nation](https://thehallucination.com/music/) which, in Wikipedia's words, *is a Canadian electronic music group who blend instrumental hip hop, reggae, moombahton and dubstep-influenced dance music with elements of First Nations music, particularly vocal chanting and drumming.* For me, their music is cool; for others, their music may be even more impactful.

(An aside: Between Drake, Justin Bieber, The Weeknd, and this group, Canada is disproportiantely good at music &ndash; almost as disproportionately good as expat Albanians; see [this *Billboard* article](https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/pop/8507787/albanian-artists-charts-dua-lipa-bebe-rexha-ava-max) to see what I'm talking about!)

Speaking of music, Lana Del Rey came out with new music yesterday! In spite of (or perhaps because of) the "industry plant" rumors that seem to surround her, I find the art she produces impressive. (As I mentioned [in this post]({% post_url 2021-05-18-who-am-i %}), I often value art for who makes it, but sometimes I value art for art's sake, and her stunningly accurate embodiment of that Americana zeitgeist makes, for me, her music worth listening to.)

If you don't like her, though, don't worry. Because I feel like different musicians (and different causes) could benefit more from my money, I only listen to her music through Spotify &ndash; and free Spotify at that &ndash; so between Spotify's stinginess and the label's cut, she's only getting something like two cents for every million of my plays of her music.

## Back to it

Now, for the event.

I ran in the morning today. Usually I run in the afternoon or evening, so the timing was, though not wholly unusual, at least somewhat less familiar than other times.

Less than a mile into this route, I turn onto a major road that curves at first before running straight for nearly a mile. Until that curve straightened out, the run was unremarkable. Then, the curve straightened, I looked to my right, and I saw a rainbow.

Rainbows are cool, and seeing one while running would at least be worth considering writing about, even if I had previously promised to not write about running. I've seen rainbows before, though, but I had never seen one like this.

For one, this rainbow was circular. For another, it was on the ground &ndash; and not just anywhere on the ground, but in a circle that went perfectly around my shadow! A marveled at it for another instant, as one would, before continuing on my run.

Here's where it gets strange.

I looked to my left again, and the rainbow was still there. Still positioned around my shadow like a force field, it was following me! With every step I took, the shadow moved forward, though not in the jerky stepping motion of a run, but with bounceless fluidity. If I adjusted my pace, so did the rainbow. I glanced to the sun, half expecting to see a plane or even some type of lens (there were none). I checked whether I was wearing some type of prism (I was not).

I was sure the rainbow would fade, and, sure enough, it began to. Then, without warning, it resurrected, springing to a more vibrant color than before.

Cars passed me on the road, and I tried to check if they, too, had rainbows surrounding their shadows. They did not. The tree shadows, likewise, had no rainbows. The only rainbow I could see was the one precisely surrounding my shadow, precisely moving with me.

>The only rainbow I could see was the one precisely surrounding my shadow, precisely moving with me.

By this point, the rainbow had lasted for 4&ndash;5 minutes &ndash; without fading, and without moving relative to myself or my shadow. Approaching the turn, I hypothesized that the change in my orientation (which would put my shadow behind me rather than to my left) might cause the rainbow to disappear. Before rounding the corner, I thought another quick prayer-slash-thanks, and passed the threshold of the bend. I looked behind to my shadow. The shadow remained, but the rainbow was gone. Hypothesis correct.

I returned to an orientation with the sun beside me (instead of in front of or behind me) about 15 minutes later. My shadow, though, remained un-rainbowed.

### Some notes on how I could've been a better scientist

My purpose when setting out for a run is to run. As a result, I spent more effort on running and less effort on investigating the rainbow and devising experiments to better understand it. In retrospect, I half regret not trying harder to figure out the rainbow, but I half appreciate that I let the mystery remain.

Here are some more science-y notes on the experience.

* I was wearing an outfit (shoes, socks, watch, shorts, shirt) that I have run in many, many times. (I only have a few pairs of shorts, and I have several copies of the shirt I wore, so this is probably my most frequent running outfit!)
* The rainbow seemed to appear better on asphalt. There was one point where I cross a road that had a wide, sidewalk-material gutter. The rainbow disappeared for this time (perhaps not fully &ndash; again, I was focused on running) and then reappeared when I reached blacktop.
* I felt no physical difference or mental difference when the rainbow was present as compared to when the rainbow was gone.
* When I turned so that I was running perpendicular to how I had been and lost the rainbow, the rainbow would've been on sidewalk. Perhaps it would've remained visible had I run in the street.
* When I turned again so that the sun was again to my side, the rainbow would've been in the street, but I did not see it any more.
* The rainbow moved relative to my full body &ndash; not with the swinging of a shoe or a watch, so being caused by some reflective thing on me seems unlikely.
* The sky was (at least roughly) cloudless.
* As mentioned above, this all happened in the first mile of the run, so I know it wasn't an exhaustion-based experience.
** Also, my GPS watch recorded my run, so I know I wasn't actually standing in place and imagining all of this for 15 minutes.
* Random notes: I ran consistently (for the first several miles) at about a 7-minute pace before slowing down due to heat at the end to about a 7:30 pace.

I think that completes the notes for now. I'll add more if I think of any.

## Concluding thoughts

In all seriousness, I feel like this experience was, if not spiritual, at least very nearly spiritual. I consider myself at least somewhat religious, and I do believe in God. (OK, the fact that I wrote the previous sentences in this paragraph just convinced me that this was a spiritual experience in some way to some degree &ndash; I am also un-religious enough that, before this paragraph, I never really thought I would mention religion on this site.)

When I told my family about the rainbow, my sister suggested &ndash; perhaps partly or fully in jest &ndash; that it was my guardian angel. Honestly, I thought the same thing at the time. I felt watched, but in a protective way. I also felt somehow appreciated and, in that moment, I felt distinctly cared for.

(I feel cared for by my family, too, but I felt cared for kind of *by the rainbow*. It made sense at the time and it makes sense now, too, having experienced it &ndash; even if it feels a little weird to type.)

The rainbow, to summarize, was crazy, wonderful, magical, touching, and fleeting. Part of me hopes to see it regularly, but part of me thinks that would ruin the magic. I imagine seeing the rainbow is kind of like going to Disney World. It's crazy the first time, and the second time, and the third time, but if you went every day, the wonder would beging to lessen. I'll let you know (1) if I see it again, (2) if my running friends have seen anything like it, or (3) if I figure anything out.

I said at the beginning of this post that *"I think I've even found that explanation"*. I no longer think I did. My explanation was some half-formed idea that had to do with the angle of the sun and the reflection off the road. But the angle had quite a bit of wiggle room since it lasted for minutes, and since my head bobs up and down to some extent when I run, and since asphalt is made of uneven chunks of who-knows-what, since the road was at least somewhat hilly, and since the rainbow was visible on the white lines of the road too.

I know some kind of physics-y, light-based stuff was going on. But anything we see is physics-y, light-based stuff since we *see* it.

I'm sure this account doesn't do justice to the event, but *man* was it awesome (in the *awe-causing* sense of "awesome", not in the *cool, dude* sense of "awesome" [but in that sense too]). In conclusion, I have no idea what happened. I do know, though, that it gave me pause and encouraged me to be more introspective. And I know that it was really, really cool, and maybe a little magical.
