When my other grandma died, I remember a part of my anguish came from the fact that it felt like it's always me.

I looked up some stats to try to figure out whether I was uniquely unlucky &ndash; lo and behold, I was. (At least by some metrics.)

The good thing about having your family in it is that they're similary affected. But, with the exception of my sister, nobody (OK, maybe one friend from high school, but he's kind of disorganized and doesn't really respond to texts anymore) knows what I went through before. And even my sister kind of said, "Yeah, that was bad."

I remember before that I said I feel like I'm on an island. And that's what keeps coming back. My other cousins: things have been better. My other friends: probably they didn't have grandmas die back to back. There are some people who have had it worse, like my one grandma's family. Also, my one grandpa was in the military (and not in peacetime), so I'm sure he experienced worse (and, honestly, he seems to have handled it pretty well). It's tough to feel like nobody has had your experiences 

The big mistake I made was rushing through the self-grief time. I was a lot less sad for my grandma than I was for other people because she had so much more time and really did a whole lot, too. I thought that would translate to me being less sad for myself. To be fair, it does, but only slightly. Grief kind of on behalf of the dead is 

I'm way too good at staying up late. I've been rocking about 6 hours of sleep, and I don't feel tired enough to go to sleep. When I did 4 hours the other night, then I felt tired enough to go to sleep. I also felt like garbage the whole day. Maybe 6 hours is the ~sleep~ sweet spot? (lol, I'd actually written sleep spot.) (To be clear, I don't usually have insomnia &ndash; it's just a grief-induced thing.)


The crazy thing is that I know some people who know people who've been killed. But more than two? And then more than that in a host of other tragedies (all independent, I might add?). That's, thankfully, rare air, but it's also my air and it stinks.

British rappers crack me up. I was watching an interview with one, and he said, "yeah, so my sister died, and then I was sad." _OK, quite fair,_ I thought. Then he explained that, aside from grandparents, that's the only close person to him who's died. This guys gang-banging like an obvious criminal, and the one person who dies is his sister who dies of cancer? I don't live that lifestyle, and I know _way_ more people. If only people around me were dying at the rate of the acquaintanes of a British gang-banger. If only my lifestyle were that risk free.

OK, this isn't productive or insightful: I'm largely rehashing old thoughts, I'm dwelling on deaths that are very much in the rearview, and I'm raging against the randomness of the universe (because, as explained in previous posts, if there were a god, why would it be doing me so dirty?). It's strange, because I barely feel done dirty here, especially compared to other things. This is a death that was clearly going to happen _eventually_, so why didn't I factor it in when accounting for my unluck in other places? And this grandma was decidedly not young (not old-old, but nobody would call her young). It's hard to say that I've been done dirty, and frankly I wouldn't say I've been done dirty. 

Anyway, this reminds me of the "bro, what are you doing it's 4am" post from ... last time. It's not 4am, but I *should* just get to bed. Seeya tomorrow.

I remember feeling a few weeks ago that things were going uncomfortably well. Well, suspicions confirmed. Can't I have a peaceful go? Yeah, but it's gonna end eventually. (And, unfortunately, it seems like it's never going to last especially long.)

I think I'm trying to move too fast because I want so badly to get back to (roughly) where I was, and because I can't stand waiting ever. (Which can be a bit of a virtue &ndash; it means I get stuff done.) At the same time, though, I'm good at waiting. I've just gotta wait.
