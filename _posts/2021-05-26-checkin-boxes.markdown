For some reason, posts this week are feeling like they're just another box to check.

Oh well &ndash; plenty of things feel like checking boxes, and this isn't too burdensome a box to check, so I'll keep at it.

I did a couple o' things today:
* had French toast for breakfast
* picked strawberries
* ran
	* almost ran faster than a bike
		* but I didn't know where the finish line was (or the start line), so I slowed down too soon
			* and then I sped back up again, but by then it was too late
				* maybe next time
	* now my calves hurt
		* but not in an injured way
* finished showering from the run literally seconds before lightning started
* ate a trifle (I didn't make it &ndash; my sister did)
* saw a lot of lightning
* did *some* work
	* I plan to do more tomorrow
* took allergy medicine for my allergies
	* this was planned in [the previous post]({% post_url 2021-05-25-i-was-tricked %})
	* I am feeling better now
		* but I will continue to take allergy medicine
* wrote some kind of weird bullet-point-based post

Well, this post felt fairly experimental, but I think it was worthwhile. Will I continue this style? Probably not. But might I return to it now and again? I might.
