As an update, I found more toothpaste in my hair this morning. Somehow, it had coalesced into a more globular form that was close to, but removed from, the location where I was finding toothpaste yesterday. Having dried to some extent, it lacked the stickiness that made yesterday's find particularly heart-pounding.

As an approximation for how much toothpaste was in my hair, I was able to roll the semi-dried stuff into a small ball with a perhaps 2&ndash;4 mm diameter: not huge, but a lot bigger than I expected (particularly seeing as I thought I had extracted all the toothpaste yesterday)!
