I was unfairly tired yesterday.

My head hurt, my eyes wanted to close, and I couldn't think. Today, I can think, but still not as well as usual. 

I took a nap from 8pm to 9:45pm, and I realized I still didn't feel great, so I decided to just call it for the night. Then (unsurprisingly-ish, since I was now semi-rested) I couldn't go to sleep.

I listed to podcasts at low volume -- this often works -- and then I read parts of two books. Then, after laying in bed for 30-ish minutes, I feel asleep around 12:30am. I woke up a few times, but my eyes still wanted to close and my head still felt off, so I didn't get out of bed until 12:50pm. 

I think this was the right move: I feel better now (though not all the way), and I think I'm positioned well enough with my work that I could afford to do this. We'll see.

## A winter running reminder

Yesterday, I ran with no gloves, and I'm pretty sure my hands incurred some damage. It was about 45 degrees out, but my hands got a little curled up, and the tips of my fingers may still be a little tingly today.

Anyway, this is a reminder to myself -- and to others -- to wear gloves, mittens, or even socks on your hands when you're running in cold and semi-cold weather. Also, tighter underwear may be of use.
