I'll keep this short.

I wasn't going to post, but just as I was going to bed, something strange happened. (I have no idea why, but strange things seem to have been happening at a ridiculously higher rate since I started posting on this thang.) I was combing my fingers through my hair, in the way that one does, when I felt what I thought was a tangle. Naturally, to prevent future me from pulling the tangle, I decided to untangle the tangle.

I quickly realized, though, that there was more to the tangle than just a tangle when, within the tangle, I felt something wet.

*Huh,* I wondered. *How is my hair still wet? I haven't been near water in about half an hour.*

I pulled at the tangle some more before realizing that the wet felt more substantial than water. Fearing the worst, I decided to smell my fingers. Thankfully, strangely, 'twas *mint*.

Anyway, somehow toothpaste &ndash; and not a very large quantity at that &ndash; got in my hair. A strange end to long weekend ( ;) ) and an action-packed month!
