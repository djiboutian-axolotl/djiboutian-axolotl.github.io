I'll keep this short.

I wasn't going to post, but just as I was going to bed, something strange happened. (I have no idea why, but strange things seem to have been happening at a ridiculously higher rate since I started posting on this thang.) I was combing my fingers through my hair, in the way that one does, when I felt what I thought was a tangle. Naturally, to prevent future me from pulling the tangle, I decided to untangle the tangle.

I quickly realized, though, that there was more to the tangle than just a tangle when, within the tangle, I felt something wet.

*Huh,* I wondered. *How is my hair still wet? I haven't been near water in about half an hour.*

I pulled at the tangle some more before realizing that the wet felt more substantial than water. Fearing the worst, I decided to smell my fingers. Thankfully, strangely, 'twas *mint*.

Anyway, somehow toothpaste &ndash; and not a very large quantity at that &ndash; got in my hair. A strange end to long weekend ( ;) ) and an action-packed month!

## Addendum

Dang, I shoulda gone to bed instead of typing up this silliness.

Now a fox is screaming outside and I won't be able to sleep until the fox quiets down. Fox screams are the literal worst! (OK, they are actually definitely not the literal worst since there are many really really bad things out there, but it gives me the heebie-jeebies when it's late at night and I've got one of those guys just *screaming* outside of my window. They always quiet down for a while, and then just when you think they're done, they start *right* back up again with a more terrifying, more skin-crawling squeal &ndash; it's beyond me why they build up to creepier and creepier squawk/scream/screeches. For whom are they performing?????)
