Just finished grading, possibly/hopefully for the last time this semester!

With regards to [this post]({% post_url 2021-05-15-what-is-grading %}), though I knew the answers, there was one question where I *barely* understood them. When I took this class *ages* ago (wink, wink), I am pretty sure I missed pretty badly on that question. Now that I have the answer key, I miss much less badly, but it is a toughie.

I am looking forward to a summer of research, running, and reading (the three r's). Hopefully I'm able to do all three. Sometimes running hurts, and sometimes it hurts too much, and then I have to stop even though I don't want to. And sometimes I forget to do (meaningful) reading &ndash; I of course read plenty of news, but news ain't books.

Well, this was a much blogg-ier, long-twitter-esque post. Guess ya gotta start somewhere!

Till next time (because otherwise the ground will be too hard to plant plants!),

Yours.
