Not that this is a competition, but today was indisputably better than yesterday.

To be clear, today wasn't good by "ye olde standards" but it was the best by far in the world of these "brave new standards". I was able to productively read some stuff! My reading was slower, the stuff I was reading was more historical/philosophical than technical, but I was able to sit and focus!

I of course ran this morning, and then I went for a bike ride + walk in the evening. I spent about 2 hours out there in the evening, which means I was doing physical activities outside for 3+ hours today. I seem to have developed quite the motor. Days like this are why I run: I want to be able to do stuff for as far and as long as I want on any day.

Soylent's slogan used to be something like, "Replaces any meal, but not every meal." I have a similar goal for running: "Run [or bike/walk/whatever] for as long as I want on any day, but not every day." These past few days of just hours upon hours of physical activity have convinced me that, if I haven't achieved that goal, then boy am I close.

Again, I just want to shout out my advisers and friends: they've made this as easy as it could be. Lots of offered support, lots of understanding, no pressure to get anything done at all in the near future. It's really nice of them.

Another piece of info (which inspired the title) is that I slept 7.5 hours last night, and I felt so great. I did 4 the night before since I'd slept 7.5 hours before _that_ and felt absolutely way too lucid. I then "strategically" sleep deprived myself, and I can tell you right now that I was not especially lucid. I felt like I was, to use a cliche, sleepwalking. Strangely, that was the intent for yesterday, and it's possible that it was the right approach since I'd really been collapsing the day before, and I figured that if I couldn't think, then I wouldn't think way too much about way too something I couldn't change. By the time today rolled around, I was ready for thoughts, so sleeping was the right move. It's possible that yesterday could've been OK, too, had I been awake for it. Not sure what I'd do if I could do it over again. Sleep (to a point) definitely tends to be good. The jury's still out, though, on whether my sleep was improperly executd this time.

I honestly don't have a lot more to say right now. I'm kind of tired, but I wanted to log my thoughts &ndash; partly for record keeping, partly to get a sense for how I viewed the day and my place in it, partly to just do something. Anyway, I'll see my family tomorrow, so I'm kind of looking forward to that. They've been seeming alright &ndash; I hope they seem that alright in person.
