Today was another relaxed day. I did not do much. I read, I went for a walk with my family, I ran.

My dad had a work dinner today, so my mom and I had French toast for dinner. We also took my dog for a walk.

Once again, in spite of the heat, I went for a shirted run. And once again, I ran at a consistent (though slower than usual, but probably healthier than usual) pace.

With regard to rainbows, I didn't see any. But I did see something that may hint at the origin of the rainbow (see [this post]({% post_url 2021-05-21-a-supernatural-event %}) for a description of my initial encounter). When I was running, I noticed that the sun was reflecting off the road &ndash; not like the road was a mirror, projecting a perfect circle of light at me, but more like the road was the rough, semi-shiny surface that it is, projecting an oval-ish lighter section in my general direction. As with the rainbow, the reflection moved with me as I ran (though, I think, with less smooth fluidity than the rainbow managed).

The hunt for the origin of the rainbow continues, albeit half-heartedly. As stated previously, I feel there's a benefit to leaving some mysteries mysterious.

I'm keeping it short tonight because I am tired.
