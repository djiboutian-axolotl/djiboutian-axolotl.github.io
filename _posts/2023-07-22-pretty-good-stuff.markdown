In the words of Ice Cube, today was a good day. I went on a phenomenal run (both long and fast), and I'm feeling ready for a long-ish, fast-ish run tomorrow too.

I also got to spend time with some friends, which was good. I think it was, in fact, much needed. I'm certainly happy to spend time by myself, but it's nice to see other people.

One thing that I forgot until recently is just how good Drakeo the Ruler is. His music is so _interesting_, and it feels trend-setting. Marketed as "nervous music", it has an undercurrent of anxiety but at the same time seems to help allay feelings of anxiety. It's both fully wired and completely chill. I'm not sure how it's done, but it helps remind me to just stress a little less.

I deliberately ran really far today because there was a special dinner today (where I got to see friends and stuff). The run went quite well. Typically I run long on Saturday and longer on Sunday, but the dinner prompted a switch. I'm quite curious to see how I perform tomorrow, because I usually follow the longer run with a short run. It'll be interesting to see what happens. I view running as a lot of self-experimentation, and this should be a fun experiment. 

I'm not feeling especially inspired to type more, so I think I'll stop. I'd like to read some of a book tonight, so I think I'll go and do that before it gets too late. Definitely a little nervous about some silly things, but I more and more recognize their silliness. I'll be alright.

Oh, one weird thing that I've never run into before is that someone sent me a message to try to make a connection, and I don't really think that I care for the connection, so I haven't responded yet. I'm normally super responsive, but I want to hint that I'm not really interested, so that's why I haven't responded. I don't want to be rude, but I also don't really want anything to happen. Part of why I respond quickly is because I can't stand the feeling of an outstanding message hanging over my head. Well, right now I have an outstanding message hanging over my head, by design. It's not very much fun, but I think it's the right approach. Moreover, I don't see a better approach, so it's like the Clinton vs. Trump election where neither option is great but there's a clear wrong option. I think the clear wrong option is to respond fast, in my standard style. Another option is to just be upfront and say, "Nah, bruv", but that actually feels worse but I don't know. Hence the nonresponsiveness, but also hence my unhappiness with that approach.
